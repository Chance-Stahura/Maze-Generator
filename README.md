Maze Generator & Solver with Joystick Control

A C++ project that:

    Generates a random maze using Primâ€™s algorithm 
    
    Finds the optimal path using A*
    
    Displays the maze and path with SFML
    
    Lets the user traverse the maze with a joystick via an Arduino serial interface

Features : 

    Random maze generation on any grid size
    
    A* pathfinding for optimal solution
    
    Interactive rendering with SFML
    
    Hardware joystick integration using Arduino

Tech Stack : 

    C++11
    
    SFML (graphics, input, rendering)
    
    Arduino (serial communication for joystick input)
    
    CMake (build system)

Planned Updates : 

  Interactive Interface
    
      Add a simple UI overlay (timer, move counter, restart option)
      
      Display current path progress vs. optimal path
  Gameplay Features
  
      Difficulty levels (different maze sizes, generation styles)
      
      Optional keyboard controls as a fallback to the joystick
  Code Quality
  
      Refactor into modular components (algorithms, rendering, input)
      
      Add automated tests and CI builds via GitHub Actions
